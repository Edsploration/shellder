## Fork - fish only!

This forked version provides a simpler codebase, the exit code number when not 0, some fixes and color changed.

## Installation

You can install shellder via your favorite plugin manager, for example, with [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher):

```shell
$ fisher install TheEdoRan/shellder
```

## Fonts

You'll need a powerline patched font. If you don't have one, download one or
patch some fonts on you own.
