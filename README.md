1. **Speed** ― Carefully optimized with slow environment like msys2
2. **No solarized** ― xterm256 colors are beautiful enough, inspired by [seoul256.vim]
3. **zsh** + **fish** support

#### Installation
[zplug][] is recommended
```zsh
# with zplug
zplug "simnalamburt/shellder"

# with zgen
zgen load simnalamburt/shellder shellder
